A super-resolution method is then applied via CNNs to enhance the image quality. Subsequently, a bounding box method isolates individual characters for precise recognition. In the recognition phase, CNNs extract features for effective classification. The study aims to advance automated vehicle identification systems for law enforcement and parking management applications, promising accurate and efficient number plate detection and recognition.
